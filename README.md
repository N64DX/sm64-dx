# Super Mario 64

This repo contains a full decompilation of Super Mario 64 (J) and (U).
The source and data have been decompiled but complete naming and documentation
all of the code and data is still a work in progress. Decompiling the (E) ROM
is also an ongoing effort.

It builds the following ROMs:

* sm64.jp.z64 `sha1: 8a20a5c83d6ceb0f0506cfc9fa20d8f438cafe51`
* sm64.us.z64 `sha1: 9bef1128717f958171a4afac3ed78ee2bb4e86ce`

This repo does not include all assets necessary for compiling the ROMs.
A prior copy of the game is required to extract the required assets.
